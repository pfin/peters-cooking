*The foundation of countless meals*

## The Truth About Rice
Everyone has "the" method. This one works every time, whether you're serving it with Nanjing chicken or using it for fried rice tomorrow.

## Ingredients
| Item | Ratio | Actual Amount | Notes |
|------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Long-grain white rice | 1 part | 1½ cups | Jasmine preferred |
| Water | 1.5 parts | 2¼ cups | Less than package says |
| Salt | Pinch | ½ tsp | Optional but recommended |

## Equipment
- Heavy-bottomed pot with tight lid
- No peeking allowed!

## Method

### 1. Rinse the Rice
- Place rice in pot
- Cover with cold water
- Swish with hand
- Drain
- Repeat 2-3 times until water runs clear
- **Why?** Removes surface starch = fluffier rice

### 2. The Precise Method
1. Add measured water to rinsed rice
2. Add salt if using
3. Bring to boil over high heat, uncovered
4. **As soon as it boils**: 
   - Stir once
   - Cover tightly
   - Reduce to lowest heat
5. Set timer for 18 minutes
6. **DO NOT LIFT THE LID**

### 3. Rest and Fluff
- Turn off heat
- Let stand 10 minutes (still covered!)
- Remove lid
- Fluff gently with fork
- Serve immediately

## The Science
- Initial boil gelatinizes starch
- Steam cooking ensures even texture
- Resting allows moisture redistribution
- Fork fluffing prevents clumping

## Common Mistakes
| Mistake | Result | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Too much water | Mushy rice | Use 1:1.5 ratio |
| Lifting lid | Uneven cooking | Trust the process |
| High heat throughout | Burnt bottom | Low after boiling |
| Skipping rest | Wet spots | Always rest 10 min |

## Variations by Rice Type

### Jasmine Rice
- Same method
- Extra aromatic
- Slightly sticky

### Basmati
- Use 1:1.75 water ratio
- Add 1 tsp oil
- Extra long grains

### Short Grain
- Use 1:1.25 ratio
- Will be stickier
- Good for Asian dishes

## Advanced Tips

### Restaurant Style
- Add 1 Tbsp butter when fluffing
- Or drizzle with sesame oil
- Toast rice in oil first

### Coconut Rice
- Replace half water with coconut milk
- Add pinch of sugar
- Great with spicy dishes

### Stock Instead
- Use chicken stock for water
- Instant flavor upgrade
- Match to your main dish

## Troubleshooting

### Rice is Crunchy
- Add 2 Tbsp hot water
- Cover and steam 5 more minutes

### Rice is Mushy
- Spread on sheet pan
- Let cool to dry out
- Perfect for fried rice tomorrow

### Burnt Bottom
- Don't scrape!
- Serve top layers
- Soak pot immediately

## Storage
- Cool completely
- Refrigerate up to 4 days
- Freeze portions for 3 months
- Reheat with splash of water

## Reheating Methods
1. **Microwave**: Add splash water, cover, 1-2 min
2. **Stovetop**: Steam with water in covered pot
3. **Fried Rice**: Best use for day-old rice

## Why This Method Works
1. Exact water ratio = consistent results
2. Tight lid = no steam escape
3. Low heat = no scorching
4. Resting = perfect texture
