# Steak Temperature Guide
*The definitive reference for perfect doneness*

## Quick Reference Chart

| Doneness | Pull Temp | Final Temp | Visual | Feel |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|------|
| Blue Rare | 110°F | 115°F | Purple-red, cool | Very soft |
| Rare | 120°F | 125°F | Bright red, cool center | Soft |
| Medium-Rare | 130°F | 135°F | Warm red center | Yielding |
| Medium | 140°F | 145°F | Warm pink throughout | Firm but yielding |
| Medium-Well | 150°F | 155°F | Slightly pink center | Firm |
| Well Done | 160°F | 165°F | No pink | Very firm |

## The Science of Carryover Cooking

### What Happens
- Internal temp continues rising after removing from heat
- Typically 5°F for steaks, up to 10°F for roasts
- Heat from exterior moves inward
- Resting allows this to happen evenly

### Factors Affecting Carryover
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Thickness | Thicker = more carryover |
| Cooking temp | Higher heat = more carryover |
| Starting temp | Cold steak = less carryover |
| Resting method | Covered = more carryover |

## Testing Doneness

### 1. Thermometer Method (Most Accurate)
- Insert into thickest part
- Avoid fat or bone
- Wait for reading to stabilize
- Check multiple spots for thick cuts

### 2. Touch Test (With Practice)
Compare to parts of your hand:
- **Rare**: Soft like relaxed thumb muscle
- **Medium-Rare**: Like thumb muscle with light pressure
- **Medium**: Like thumb muscle with moderate pressure
- **Well**: Like thumb muscle fully tensed

### 3. Visual Cues
- Juices pooling on top
- Sides firming up
- Color changing up the sides
- Easy release from pan/grill

## Steak by Steak Guide

### Filet Mignon
- Best at: Medium-rare to medium
- Why: Lean cut needs some pink
- Pull at: 130-140°F

### Ribeye
- Best at: Medium-rare to medium
- Why: Fat renders best here
- Pull at: 130-140°F

### Strip Steak
- Best at: Medium-rare
- Why: Good fat/lean balance
- Pull at: 130°F

### Flank/Skirt
- Best at: Medium-rare max
- Why: Gets tough if overcooked
- Pull at: 125-130°F

### Porterhouse/T-Bone
- Challenge: Two muscles cook differently
- Solution: Position strip toward heat
- Pull at: 130°F

## Reverse Sear Method

For thick steaks (2+ inches):
1. Season and rest 45 min
2. Bake at 275°F on wire rack
3. Pull 10°F below target
4. Sear in hot pan 1 min per side
5. Perfect edge-to-edge doneness

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Result | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Cutting too soon | Juice loss | Always rest 5-10 min |
| Only checking once | Uneven cooking | Check multiple spots |
| Forgetting carryover | Overcooked | Pull 5°F early |
| Cold steak | Gray band | Room temp 45 min |

## Special Considerations

### High Altitude
- Lower air pressure = lower boiling point
- May need slightly higher temps
- Longer cooking times

### Frozen Steaks
- Can cook from frozen
- Takes 50% longer
- Better crust formation
- No gray band

### Sous Vide
- Set exact final temp
- No carryover cooking
- Need hard sear after
- Edge-to-edge perfection

## Resting Guidelines

| Steak Thickness | Rest Time | Method |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Under 1 inch | 3-5 min | Plate, uncovered |
| 1-1.5 inches | 5-7 min | Plate, loose foil |
| Over 1.5 inches | 8-10 min | Board, loose foil |
| Whole roast | 15-20 min | Board, tented |

## The Perfect Medium-Rare

The most ordered doneness because:
- Proteins are denatured (tender)
- Fat is rendered (flavorful)
- Moisture retained (juicy)
- Myoglobin still red (appealing)

Target: 130-135°F final temp

## Troubleshooting

**Steak is tough but cooked right**
- Wrong cut for method
- Didn't slice against grain
- Needed marinade/tenderizing

**Perfect temp but no crust**
- Pan not hot enough
- Steak too wet
- Overcrowded pan

**Overcooked outside, raw inside**
- Heat too high
- Steak too cold
- Try reverse sear
