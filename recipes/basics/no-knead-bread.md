# No-Knead Bread
*The easiest bread with the best crust*

## Overview
| Yield | Active Time | Total Time | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 loaf | 10 min | 18-24 hours | Easiest |

## The Magic
Developed by Jim Lahey, this method uses time instead of kneading to develop gluten. Perfect for busy parents who want fresh bread without the work.

## Ingredients

| Item | Grams | US Measure | Baker's % |
|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Bread flour | 400g | 3 cups | 100% |
| Water | 300g | 1⅓ cups | 75% |
| Salt | 8g | 1¼ tsp | 2% |
| Instant yeast | 2g | ½ tsp | 0.5% |

**Note**: Weighing is more accurate than cups

## Equipment
- Large bowl
- Plastic wrap or kitchen towel
- Dutch oven with lid (crucial!)
- Parchment paper

## Method

### Day 1 - Mix (5 minutes)
1. **5:00 PM**: Whisk dry ingredients in large bowl
2. Add water, stir until shaggy dough forms
3. **No dry flour should remain** but dough will be rough
4. Cover tightly with plastic wrap
5. Leave at room temperature 12-18 hours

### What's Happening
- Long fermentation develops flavor
- Gluten forms without kneading
- Dough will double and bubble

### Day 2 - Shape and Bake (5 min active)
1. **8:00 AM**: Dough ready when:
   - Surface is dotted with bubbles
   - Jiggles when shaken
   - Smells yeasty and fermented

2. **First Fold**:
   - Flour work surface generously
   - Scrape dough out (it's sticky!)
   - Fold dough over itself 4 times
   - Cover, rest 15 minutes

3. **Shape**:
   - Quick fold into rough ball
   - Place seam-side down on parchment
   - Cover with towel
   - Rise 2 hours until doubled

4. **Bake Prep** (30 min before):
   - Place Dutch oven in oven
   - Preheat to 450°F (230°C)
   - Critical: Pot must be screaming hot

5. **Bake**:
   - Carefully transfer dough on parchment to pot
   - Cover with lid
   - Bake 30 minutes covered
   - Remove lid, bake 15-30 min until deep brown

6. **Cool**:
   - Transfer to wire rack
   - **Wait 1 hour** before cutting (hardest part!)

## Understanding the Variables

### Timing Flexibility
| First Rise | Flavor | Texture |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 12 hours | Mild | Tender |
| 18 hours | Complex | Chewier |
| 24 hours | Tangy | Dense |

### Temperature Effects
- Warmer = faster rise, milder flavor
- Cooler = slower rise, more complex flavor
- 70°F (21°C) is ideal

### Hydration
- This is 75% hydration (wet dough)
- Wet = open crumb, crispy crust
- Sticky is normal!

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Dense bread | Not enough rise time | Wait for bubbles |
| Gummy interior | Cut too soon | Cool completely |
| Pale crust | Oven not hot enough | Check temperature |
| Burnt bottom | Rack too low | Move up one level |

## Variations

### Whole Wheat
- Replace 100g white flour with whole wheat
- Add 1 Tbsp extra water
- Slightly denser, nuttier flavor

### Seeded
- Add 2 Tbsp each:
  - Sesame seeds
  - Poppy seeds
  - Sunflower seeds
- Mix with flour

### Olive-Rosemary
- ½ cup chopped olives
- 2 Tbsp fresh rosemary
- Fold in during shaping

## Schedule Examples

### Weekday Bread
- Wednesday 6 PM: Mix dough
- Thursday 8 AM: Shape
- Thursday 10 AM: Bake
- Thursday 11 AM: Fresh bread for lunch

### Weekend Bread
- Friday 10 PM: Mix dough
- Saturday 2 PM: Shape
- Saturday 4 PM: Bake
- Saturday 5 PM: Dinner rolls

## Storage
| Method | Duration | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Counter | 2 days | Wrapped in towel |
| Freeze | 3 months | Slice first |
| Refresh | 5 min at 350°F | Revive crust |

## Why This Works
- Long fermentation = flavor + gluten
- High hydration = open crumb
- Dutch oven = steam for crust
- High heat = oven spring

## Final Tips
1. Wetter is better (resist adding flour)
2. Dutch oven is non-negotiable
3. Use parchment for easy transfer
4. Trust the timing guides
5. The crust will soften as it cools (normal)
