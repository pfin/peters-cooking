# Nanjing Salted Duck (南京盐水鸭)

The most famous dish from Nanjing, known for its tender meat and delicate flavor. This simplified version captures the essence while being practical for home cooking.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole duck (4-5 lbs) or 4 duck leg quarters
- 1/2 cup coarse salt
- 2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns
- 1 tbsp white peppercorns
- 4 star anise
- 3 bay leaves
- 6 slices ginger
- 4 green onions
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- Fresh ginger-scallion oil for serving (optional)

## Dry Brine (Day 1)

1. Toast Sichuan peppercorns and white peppercorns in dry pan until fragrant, about 2 minutes.

2. Grind toasted peppercorns with salt.

3. Pat duck completely dry. Rub salt mixture all over duck, inside and out.

4. Place in container, cover, refrigerate for 24 hours.

## Cooking (Day 2)

1. Rinse duck thoroughly under cold water to remove salt. Pat dry.

2. In a large pot, add duck, cover with water by 2 inches.

3. Add star anise, bay leaves, ginger, green onions, and wine.

4. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to lowest simmer.

5. Simmer very gently for 1.5 hours (duck should never boil).

6. Turn off heat, let duck cool in the liquid for 30 minutes.

7. Remove duck, let cool completely. Refrigerate until chilled.

## Serving

1. Slice duck thinly, arrange on platter.

2. Serve cold or at room temperature.

3. Optional: Drizzle with ginger-scallion oil (minced ginger and scallions in hot oil).

## Authentic Notes

- The cooking liquid should barely move - vigorous boiling makes the meat tough
- The duck is traditionally served cold to appreciate its delicate flavor
- The spicing is subtle - it should enhance, not mask the duck
- This is a celebration dish in Nanjing, often served at banquets
