# Nanjing-Style Braised Fish (南京红烧鱼)

A classic Nanjing dish featuring delicate flavors and a light, savory-sweet sauce that exemplifies the region's mellow approach to seasoning.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole fish (2 lbs, carp or sea bass), cleaned and scaled
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 slices fresh ginger
- 3 green onions, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- 3 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp dark soy sauce (for color)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 cup fish or chicken stock
- 1 tsp white pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 tbsp water
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions

1. Make 3 diagonal cuts on each side of the fish. Pat dry and season lightly with salt.

2. Heat oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat.

3. Carefully slide fish into pan, fry 3-4 minutes each side until golden. Remove and set aside.

4. In the same oil, add ginger, white parts of green onions, and garlic. Stir-fry 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. Add Shaoxing wine, let it sizzle for a few seconds.

6. Add both soy sauces, sugar, and stock. Bring to a gentle simmer.

7. Return fish to pan, add white pepper. Cover and simmer 8-10 minutes, spooning sauce over fish occasionally.

8. Add green parts of onions, simmer 2 more minutes.

9. Thicken sauce with cornstarch slurry if desired.

10. Transfer to platter, garnish with cilantro.

## Nanjing Notes

- The sauce should be light and not overpower the fish's natural flavor
- Unlike spicier regional styles, this uses no chili or strong spices
- The balance of sweet and savory should be subtle
- Fresh ingredients are key to authentic Nanjing taste
