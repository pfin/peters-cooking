# Perfect Pan-Seared Steak
*Restaurant quality at home*

## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Cook Time | Rest Time | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 servings | 45 min | 10 min | 5 min | 1 hour |

## The Method
This technique works for any quality steak - ribeye, NY strip, or filet. The key is temperature control and proper searing.

## Ingredients

### The Steak
| Cut | Thickness | Weight | Serves |
|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| Ribeye | 1.5 inches | 12-14 oz | 1-2 |
| NY Strip | 1.5 inches | 10-12 oz | 1 |
| Filet Mignon | 2 inches | 6-8 oz | 1 |

### Essentials
| Item | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Kosher salt | 1 tsp per side | Draws moisture, forms crust |
| Black pepper | ½ tsp per side | Fresh cracked only |
| High-smoke oil | 1-2 Tbsp | Grapeseed or avocado |
| Butter | 2 Tbsp | For basting |
| Fresh thyme | 2-3 sprigs | Aromatic |
| Garlic | 2 cloves | Crushed |

## Method

### 1. The 45-Minute Rule
- Remove steak from fridge 45 minutes before cooking
- Pat completely dry with paper towels
- Season generously with salt
- Let sit at room temp
- **Why?** Even cooking, better crust

### 2. Pre-Sear Prep
- Pat dry again (salt draws moisture)
- Season with pepper just before cooking
- Heat cast iron or heavy pan over high heat
- Pan is ready when water droplet dances

### 3. The Sear
- Add oil, swirl to coat
- Lay steak away from you (prevents splatter)
- **DO NOT MOVE IT** for 3-4 minutes
- Flip when easy to lift
- Sear other side 3-4 minutes

### 4. The Finish
- Reduce heat to medium
- Add butter, thyme, garlic
- Tilt pan, baste continuously
- Cook to desired doneness (see chart)

### 5. Rest
- Transfer to cutting board
- Tent loosely with foil
- Rest 5 minutes minimum
- Slice against the grain

## Temperature Guide

| Doneness | Internal Temp | Remove at | Description |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Rare | 125°F | 120°F | Cool red center |
| Medium-Rare | 135°F | 130°F | Warm red center |
| Medium | 145°F | 140°F | Warm pink center |
| Medium-Well | 155°F | 150°F | Slightly pink |
| Well | 165°F | 160°F | No pink |

**Note**: Temp rises 5°F during rest

## The Science

### Why This Works
1. **Dry surface** = Maillard reaction = crust
2. **High heat** = caramelization 
3. **Butter basting** = even browning + flavor
4. **Resting** = juice redistribution

### Common Mistakes
- Cold steak = uneven cooking
- Moving too soon = no crust
- Overcrowding pan = steaming
- Skipping rest = juice loss

## Sauce Options

### Simple Pan Sauce
After removing steak:
1. Pour out excess fat
2. Add ½ cup red wine
3. Scrape up brown bits
4. Reduce by half
5. Swirl in 1 Tbsp cold butter
6. Season with salt

### Compound Butter
Mix softened butter with:
- Minced herbs
- Roasted garlic
- Blue cheese
- Lemon zest

## Pro Tips
1. Use a meat thermometer
2. Don't salt too early (except the 45-min method)
3. One steak per pan for best results
4. Save pan drippings for eggs tomorrow
5. Slice for sharing, keep whole for individual

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Gray band | Too high heat | Lower after sear |
| No crust | Pan not hot enough | Wait for smoke |
| Overcooked | Didn't account for carryover | Remove 5°F early |
| Tough | Cut with grain | Always against grain |

## Side Suggestions
- Simple arugula salad
- Roasted asparagus
- Crispy smashed potatoes
- The compound butter is enough!
