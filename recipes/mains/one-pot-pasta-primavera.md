# One-Pot Pasta Primavera
*Everything cooks together - pasta, veggies, and sauce*

## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Cook Time | Total | Pots to Wash |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-6 servings | 15 min | 15 min | 30 min | Just 1! |

## The Concept
Pasta cooks directly in its sauce with the vegetables. The starch from the pasta creates a silky sauce. Perfect for weeknight family dinners.

## Ingredients

### Base
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Pasta | 12 oz (340g) | Short shapes work best |
| Vegetable broth | 4 cups (1L) | Or water + bouillon |
| Garlic | 4 cloves | Minced |
| Olive oil | 3 Tbsp | Good quality |
| Red pepper flakes | ¼ tsp | Adjust to taste |

### Vegetables (3-4 cups total)
Pick what you have:
- Cherry tomatoes, halved
- Zucchini, diced
- Bell peppers, strips
- Broccoli florets
- Spinach (add last)
- Peas (frozen OK)
- Asparagus, cut in pieces

### Finish
| Item | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Parmesan | ½ cup | Freshly grated |
| Heavy cream | ¼ cup | Optional richness |
| Fresh basil | ¼ cup | Torn |
| Lemon | 1 | Zest and juice |
| Salt & pepper | To taste | Essential |

## Method

### 1. Setup (5 minutes)
- Use wide, deep skillet or Dutch oven
- Prep all vegetables
- Measure liquids
- Grate cheese

### 2. Build Base
- Heat olive oil over medium-high
- Add garlic and red pepper, 30 seconds
- Add hardest veggies first (broccoli, peppers)
- Cook 2-3 minutes

### 3. Add Everything
- Add pasta, spreading in even layer
- Pour broth to just cover pasta
- Add tomatoes if using
- Season with salt and pepper

### 4. The Magic
- Bring to boil, then active simmer
- **Stir every 2-3 minutes**
- Liquid reduces as pasta cooks
- Add soft veggies in last 5 minutes

### 5. Finish
- When pasta is al dente (10-12 min):
  - Most liquid should be absorbed
  - Starchy sauce coating everything
- Remove from heat
- Add cheese, cream if using
- Stir in basil and lemon

## The Science

### Why One-Pot Works
1. Pasta releases starch → thickens liquid
2. Vegetables release water → more sauce
3. Everything flavors everything
4. Less dilution than draining

### Liquid Ratio
- Start with just covering pasta
- Add hot water if needed
- Should be saucy, not soupy
- Sauce thickens as it sits

## Customizations

### Protein Additions
- Cooked chicken, cubed
- Shrimp (last 5 minutes)
- White beans
- Crispy pancetta

### Vegetable Seasons
**Spring**: Asparagus, peas, herbs
**Summer**: Zucchini, tomatoes, basil
**Fall**: Mushrooms, kale, squash
**Winter**: Broccoli, cauliflower, spinach

### Make it Heartier
- Use half broth, half cream
- Add more cheese
- Finish with butter

### Make it Lighter
- All broth, no cream
- Extra lemon
- More herbs

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Too dry | Not enough liquid | Add hot water |
| Too soupy | Too much liquid | Cook uncovered longer |
| Pasta mushy | Overcooked | Watch timing |
| Bland | Under-seasoned | More salt, lemon |

## Tips for Success

### Pasta Choice
- **Best**: Penne, rigatoni, shells
- **Good**: Farfalle, orecchiette
- **Avoid**: Long pasta, tiny shapes

### Vegetable Timing
1. **Hard** (5 min): Carrots, broccoli stems
2. **Medium** (3 min): Peppers, zucchini
3. **Soft** (1 min): Tomatoes, spinach

### Stirring Matters
- Prevents sticking
- Ensures even cooking
- Develops creamy sauce

## Make-Ahead Notes
- Prep veggies morning of
- Measure dry ingredients
- Not great as leftovers (pasta absorbs sauce)
- Add splash of broth when reheating

## Kid-Friendly Tweaks
- Use their favorite veggies only
- Separate portions before spicing
- Let them add own cheese
- Fun pasta shapes

## Adult Upgrades
- Finish with truffle oil
- Add anchovies with garlic
- Use wine for part of liquid
- Top with crispy breadcrumbs

## Why This Recipe Rocks
1. Minimal cleanup
2. Vegetables hidden in sauce
3. Easily scaled up/down
4. Uses what's in fridge
5. Ready in 30 minutes
