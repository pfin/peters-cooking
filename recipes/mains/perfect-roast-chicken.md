# Perfect Roast Chicken
*Crispy skin, juicy meat, minimal effort*

## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Cook Time | Rest Time | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-6 servings | 15 min | 1-1.5 hours | 15 min | ~2 hours |

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Whole chicken | 4-5 lbs (1.8-2.3 kg) | Room temperature |
| Kosher salt | 2 Tbsp | For dry brine |
| Black pepper | 1 Tbsp | Freshly ground |
| Olive oil or softened butter | 2-3 Tbsp | For the skin |

### Aromatics (Optional but Recommended)
| Item | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Lemon | 1, halved | Cavity seasoning |
| Fresh herbs | Small bunch | Thyme, rosemary, or sage |
| Garlic | 4-6 cloves | Smashed, unpeeled |
| Onion | 1, quartered | Flavor base |

## Equipment
- Roasting pan or cast iron skillet
- Instant-read thermometer (essential!)
- Kitchen twine (optional)
- Paper towels

## Method

### 1. Dry Brine (Best if time allows)
- **Night before**: Pat chicken completely dry inside and out
- Season liberally with salt all over, including cavity
- Place uncovered in fridge overnight
- This dries the skin and seasons the meat

### 2. Prep Day-Of
- Remove from fridge 45-60 minutes before cooking
- Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C)
- Pat dry again with paper towels
- **Critical**: Skin must be completely dry

### 3. Season
- Rub all over with oil or softened butter
- Season with pepper (salt already applied)
- Stuff cavity with lemon and herbs if using
- Tuck wing tips under

### 4. Roasting Setup
- Place breast-up in roasting pan
- Scatter onion and garlic around if using
- No need to truss unless you prefer the look

### 5. Roast
| Phase | Temperature | Time | Check |
|-------|-------------|------|-------|
| Entire cook | 425°F (220°C) | 20 min/lb | Internal temp |

- **Target**: 165°F (74°C) in thickest part of thigh
- Breast should read 155°F (will carryover cook)
- Skin should be deep golden brown

### 6. Rest
- Transfer to cutting board
- Tent loosely with foil
- Rest 15 minutes minimum
- Juices will redistribute

## The Science Behind Success

### Why This Works
1. **Dry skin = crispy skin**: Moisture is the enemy of crispiness
2. **High heat throughout**: No need to start high and reduce
3. **Salt penetration**: Dry brining seasons throughout
4. **Resting**: Prevents juices from running out when carved

### Temperature Notes
- Dark meat (thighs/legs): Safe and best at 165-175°F
- White meat (breast): Best at 155-160°F
- The difference in positioning helps achieve both

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Next Time |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Soggy skin | Too wet, too low temp | Dry more, check oven temp |
| Dry breast | Overcooked | Pull at 155°F breast temp |
| Uneven cooking | Wrong size pan | Use appropriate vessel |
| Pale skin | Not enough fat | More oil/butter on skin |

## Variations

### Herb Butter Under Skin
1. Mix softened butter with minced herbs
2. Carefully separate skin from breast
3. Spread mixture under skin
4. Proceed with recipe

### Spice Rubs
- Paprika + garlic powder + onion powder
- Chinese five-spice + sesame oil
- Harissa paste mixed with oil

### Vegetable Bed
- Place chicken on bed of:
  - Potatoes, carrots, onions
  - They'll cook in the drippings!

## Leftover Gold
- Carcass → stock
- Shredded meat → chicken salad
- Crispy skin → chef's snack (don't tell)

## Pro Tips
1. **Spatchcocking**: Removes backbone for faster, more even cooking
2. **Vertical roasting**: Beer can method works but isn't necessary
3. **Basting**: Not needed! Opens oven, lowers temp, doesn't help
4. **Multiple chickens**: Same time, more leftovers

## Safety Notes
- Always use thermometer, not timing alone
- Wash everything that touches raw chicken
- Don't stuff too tightly - affects cooking
