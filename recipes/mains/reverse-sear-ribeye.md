# Reverse Sear Ribeye

The ultimate method for a perfectly cooked, edge-to-edge pink ribeye with a beautiful crust.

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp high-heat oil (avocado or grapeseed)
- 2 tbsp butter
- 3 garlic cloves, crushed

## Instructions

### Low Temperature Roast

2. Let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.

3. Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C).

4. Place steaks on wire rack over baking sheet.

   - Rare: 90°F (32°C)
   - Medium-rare: 100°F (38°C)

6. This takes 20-30 minutes depending on thickness.

### The Sear
