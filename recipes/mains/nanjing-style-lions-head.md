# Nanjing-Style Lion's Head Meatballs (狮子头)

Large, tender pork meatballs braised with cabbage - a Jiangsu province specialty that showcases the region's preference for gentle, comforting flavors.

## Ingredients

### For the Meatballs:
- 1 lb ground pork (70% lean, 30% fat)
- 4 water chestnuts, finely diced
- 2 green onions, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
- 1 egg
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp white pepper
- 1/4 cup cold water

### For Braising:
- 1 lb napa cabbage, cut into large pieces
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 slices ginger
- Oil for frying

## Instructions

1. Mix all meatball ingredients gently with chopsticks in one direction until sticky, about 3 minutes. The mixture should be light and fluffy.

2. Wet hands, form mixture into 4 large meatballs (about tennis ball size).

3. Heat 1 inch of oil to 350°F. Carefully fry meatballs until golden all over, about 5 minutes. Remove and drain.

4. In a clay pot or heavy Dutch oven, layer half the cabbage on bottom.

5. Place meatballs on cabbage, add remaining cabbage around them.

6. Mix stock with soy sauces, sugar, and ginger. Pour over meatballs.

7. Bring to gentle simmer, cover, cook for 1.5 hours on low heat.

8. The cabbage should be very tender and the meatballs silky soft.

- The meatballs should be tender, not dense - mix gently
- Water chestnuts add a subtle crunch
- The long, slow braising is essential
- Unlike spicier versions, Nanjing style emphasizes the pork's natural sweetness
- Traditionally served in the clay pot for presentation
