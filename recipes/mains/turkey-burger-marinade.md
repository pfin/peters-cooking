# Wine-Marinated Turkey Burgers

Juicy turkey burgers with a 60-minute wine marinade that adds moisture and complex flavor.

## Ingredients

### For the Marinade:
- 1/4 cup dry white cooking wine (or light red)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

### For the Burgers:
- 1 lb ground turkey (93-94% lean)
- 2 tbsp marinade (reserved from above)
- 2 tbsp fine breadcrumbs or oat flour
- Additional oil for cooking
- Cheese for topping (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Make the marinade**: Whisk all marinade ingredients in a shallow dish until well combined.

2. **Form patties**: Gently mix ground turkey with 2 tbsp of the marinade and breadcrumbs. Shape into 4 patties, 3/4-inch thick with a thumb dimple in center.

3. **Marinate**: Lay patties in remaining marinade, turning to coat. Cover and refrigerate exactly 60 minutes (longer can make surface mushy).

4. **Cook**: Heat grill or skillet to medium-high with light oil. Cook 4-5 minutes per side until internal temp reaches 165Â°F. Add cheese last minute if desired.

5. **Rest and serve**: Rest 2 minutes before serving on toasted buns.
