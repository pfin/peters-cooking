## Ingredients
- 2 cups pure maple syrup
- 1/2 cup turbinado or brown sugar
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Pinch of salt
- Candy molds or lined pan

## Instructions
1. Combine maple syrup, sugar, cream, butter, and salt in heavy saucepan.
2. Cook over medium heat, stirring until sugar dissolves.
3. Attach candy thermometer and cook without stirring to soft-ball stage (235-240째F).
4. Remove from heat immediately.
5. Let cool undisturbed to 110째F (about 10-15 minutes).
6. Beat vigorously with wooden spoon until mixture loses gloss and thickens.
7. Quickly pour into molds or pan.
8. Let set at room temperature 2-3 hours.
9. Store in airtight container.

## Temperature Tips (February 18 update)
- Stirring at 110째F = creamy, smooth texture
- Stirring at 180째F = grainy, crystallized texture
- Temperature when stirring greatly affects final texture

## Notes
- Brown sugar adds caramel notes
- Don't stir while cooking to prevent crystallization
- Work quickly once beating - mixture sets fast
