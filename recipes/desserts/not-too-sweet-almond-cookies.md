## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Chill Time | Bake Time | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 24 cookies | 15 min | 30 min | 15 min | 1 hour |

## Background
These are inspired by traditional Chinese almond cookies - less sweet than American cookies, with a distinctive crumbly-tender texture. Perfect for when Allie is older and can enjoy nuts safely.

- Flatten slightly with palm

### 5. Traditional Touch
- Brush with egg wash
- Press almond into center of each
- Sprinkle with coarse sugar if desired

### 6. Bake
- 12-15 minutes

- Centers may look underdone
- **They firm up as they cool!**

### 7. Cool

## The Texture Secret
- Oil + butter = tender crumb
- Not too much sugar = crispy-tender
- Almond flour = delicate texture
- Don't overbake = stays tender

## Variations

### Traditional Style
- Add 1 Tbsp white sesame seeds to dough
- Use lard instead of butter (authentic!)

### Modern Twists
- Matcha powder (2 tsp)
- Orange zest
- Dip in white chocolate

### Nut-Free Version
- Omit almond flour and almonds
- Use vanilla extract
- Press in chocolate chip

## Storage

| Freeze baked | 2 months | Layer with parchment |

## Pro Tips
1. Measure flour correctly (spoon and level)
2. Don't skip the chill time
3. Underbake slightly for tender cookies
4. Egg wash makes them golden
5. Let cool completely for best texture

## Tea Pairing
- Jasmine tea (classic)
- Oolong
- Light green tea
- Even coffee works!

## Cultural Note
In Chinese bakeries, these are often given during holidays. The round shape symbolizes unity and completeness. The almond represents good fortune.
