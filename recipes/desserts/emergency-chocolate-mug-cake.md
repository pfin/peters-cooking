# Emergency Chocolate Mug Cake
*When you need chocolate cake in 3 minutes*

## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Cook Time | Total | Dishes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 serving | 2 min | 1 min | 3 min | 1 mug! |

## The Situation
It's 9 PM. Allie's asleep. You need chocolate. This is your solution.

## Ingredients

### In a Microwave-Safe Mug
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| All-purpose flour | 4 Tbsp | Level, not heaped |
| Sugar | 4 Tbsp | Regular granulated |
| Cocoa powder | 2 Tbsp | Unsweetened |
| Baking powder | ¼ tsp | Fresh for best rise |
| Salt | Pinch | Enhances chocolate |
| Egg | 1 small | Or 3 Tbsp beaten egg |
| Milk | 3 Tbsp | Any type works |
| Oil | 2 Tbsp | Neutral flavor |
| Vanilla | ¼ tsp | Optional but good |

### Optional Mix-ins (pick one)
- 1 Tbsp chocolate chips
- 1 Tbsp peanut butter
- 1 Tbsp Nutella
- 1 tsp instant coffee (mocha!)

## Method

### 1. Mix Dry (30 seconds)
- Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, salt to mug
- Stir with fork until uniform
- Break up any cocoa lumps

### 2. Add Wet (30 seconds)
- Crack in egg
- Add milk, oil, vanilla
- Mix thoroughly until smooth
- Scrape bottom corners

### 3. Optional Additions (10 seconds)
- Stir in chocolate chips
- OR drop peanut butter in center
- OR swirl in Nutella

### 4. Microwave
| Wattage | Time | Check |
|---------|------|-------|
| 1000W | 60-70 sec | Risen, set top |
| 1200W | 50-60 sec | May need less |
| 800W | 70-90 sec | Watch carefully |

**Stop when**: Top looks set but slightly wet

### 5. Eat Immediately
- Let cool 30 seconds (it's lava hot)
- Eat straight from mug
- Ice cream on top = heaven

## The Science

### Why It Works
- Microwave heats water molecules
- Steam creates rise (no gluten needed)
- Oil keeps it moist
- Egg provides structure

### Critical Points
1. **Don't overmix** - tough cake
2. **Don't overcook** - rubber cake
3. **Use big mug** - it rises a lot
4. **Level measurements** - ratios matter

## Variations

### Vanilla Mug Cake
- Omit cocoa
- Add extra 2 Tbsp flour
- Increase vanilla to ½ tsp
- Add lemon zest

### Funfetti
- Use vanilla base
- Add 1 Tbsp sprinkles
- Birthday cake in a mug!

### Peanut Butter
- Replace 1 Tbsp flour with PB powder
- Swirl in 1 Tbsp PB before cooking

### "Healthy" Version
- Use whole wheat flour
- Replace sugar with honey (3 Tbsp)
- Add mashed banana
- (Still cake though)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Overflow | Mug too small | Use 12oz+ mug |
| Rubbery | Overcooked | Reduce time |
| Dense | Overmixed | Stir just until combined |
| Dry | Too much flour | Level measurements |

## Mug Selection
- **Best**: Wide ceramic mug (12-16 oz)
- **Avoid**: Narrow mugs, metal trim
- **Check**: Microwave-safe bottom

## Scaling Up?
- Make individual mugs (better than one big one)
- Prep dry ingredients in batches
- Store dry mix in jar for faster cake

## Pro Tips
1. Room temp egg mixes easier
2. Sift cocoa for smoothness
3. Spray mug with oil first (easier cleanup)
4. Undercook slightly (continues cooking)
5. Whipped cream covers all sins

## Serving Suggestions
- **Classic**: Vanilla ice cream
- **Fancy**: Whipped cream + berries
- **Decadent**: Caramel sauce
- **Simple**: Powdered sugar dust

## Warning
This recipe is dangerous. You're 3 minutes away from cake at all times. Use this power wisely.
