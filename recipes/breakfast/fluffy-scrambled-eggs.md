# Fluffy Scrambled Eggs

The secret to restaurant-quality scrambled eggs: low heat, constant movement, and knowing when to stop.

## Ingredients

- 6 large eggs
- 3 tbsp heavy cream or milk
- 2 tbsp butter
- Salt and white pepper to taste
- Fresh chives for garnish (optional)

## Classic Method

1. Crack eggs into bowl, add cream, salt, and pepper.

2. Whisk thoroughly until completely uniform - no streaks.

3. Heat butter in non-stick pan over medium-low heat.

4. When butter foams, pour in eggs.

5. Let sit 20 seconds, then gently stir with rubber spatula.

6. Push eggs from edges to center, tilting pan to let liquid flow.

7. Continue folding gently - don't stir vigorously.

8. Remove from heat while still slightly wet (they'll finish cooking).

9. Let rest 30 seconds, garnish with chives.
