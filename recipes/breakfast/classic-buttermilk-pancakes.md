# Classic Buttermilk Pancakes

Fluffy, tender pancakes with a slight tang from buttermilk. The gold standard for weekend breakfast.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup melted butter, cooled slightly
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Butter for cooking

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.

2. In another bowl, whisk buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.

3. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Stir just until combined - lumps are okay!

4. Let batter rest 5 minutes while griddle heats.

5. Heat griddle or skillet over medium heat. Add butter to coat.

6. Pour 1/4 cup batter for each pancake.

7. Cook until bubbles form and pop on surface, edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.

8. Flip and cook until golden brown, 1-2 minutes more.

9. Keep warm in 200Â°F oven while cooking remaining pancakes.

## Pro Tips

- Buttermilk substitute: 2 cups milk + 2 tbsp lemon juice, let sit 5 minutes
- First pancake is always a test - adjust heat as needed
- Batter keeps in fridge for 2 days

## Toppings

- Classic: Butter and maple syrup
- Fresh berries and whipped cream
- Sliced bananas and honey
- Chocolate chips (add to batter)
