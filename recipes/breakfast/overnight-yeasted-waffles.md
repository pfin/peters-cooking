The secret to the crispiest, most flavorful waffles. Worth planning ahead!

## Ingredients

### Overnight Sponge:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp instant yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cups warm milk (110Â°F)
- 1/2 cup melted butter

### Morning Addition:
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp baking soda

## Instructions

### Night Before:
1. Mix flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in large bowl.

2. Whisk in warm milk and melted butter until smooth.

3. Cover with plastic wrap, let sit at room temperature overnight (8-12 hours).

4. Batter will be bubbly and doubled in size.

### Morning:
1. Preheat waffle iron.

2. Whisk eggs, vanilla, and baking soda into overnight sponge.

3. Batter will deflate slightly - this is normal.

4. Cook in waffle iron until deeply golden and crispy.

5. These take slightly longer to cook due to yeast.
