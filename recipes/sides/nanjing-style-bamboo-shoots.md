A classic Jiangsu side dish featuring the region's beloved bamboo shoots in a light, savory sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb fresh bamboo shoots (or 1 can whole bamboo shoots)

- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid or chicken stock
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 green onions, cut into 1-inch pieces
- Salt to taste

## Preparation

## Cooking

2. Add bamboo shoots, stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until edges are lightly golden.

3. Add mushrooms, stir-fry 1 minute.

4. Add soy sauce, wine, sugar, and stock.

5. Bring to simmer, cover, cook 10 minutes.

6. Remove lid, increase heat to reduce sauce by half.

7. Add green onions and sesame oil, toss briefly.

## Nanjing Style Notes

- The dish should be savory with just a hint of sweetness
- The bamboo texture should be tender but still have a slight crunch
- Unlike Sichuan versions, this has no chili or strong spices
- Often served at room temperature as part of a cold appetizer plate
