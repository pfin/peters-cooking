## Ingredients
| Item | Metric | US Volume | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Yukon Gold potatoes | 1 kg | ~2.2 lb (6 medium) | Peeled or well-scrubbed |
| Kosher salt (for water) | 15 g | 1 Tbsp | Seasons interior |
| Unsalted butter | 85 g | 6 Tbsp | Room temperature |
| Whole milk | 180 mL | ¾ cup | Or use half milk, half cream |
| Fine sea salt | To taste | — | Final seasoning |
| White pepper | To taste | — | Or black pepper |

### Optional Add-ins
- Roasted garlic purée
- Chopped chives
- Crème fraîche
- Grated Parmesan

## Equipment
- 4-qt (3.8 L) heavy pot
- Colander
- Potato ricer or masher (ricer preferred)
- Silicone spatula

## Method

### 1. Prep the Potatoes
- Cut into 1½ inch (4 cm) uniform chunks
- Rinse briefly under cold water to remove surface starch

### 2. Cold-Start Cooking
- Place potatoes in pot, cover with cold water by 1 inch
- Add 1 Tbsp kosher salt
- Why cold start? Ensures even cooking from center out

### 3. Cook Gently
- Bring to gentle boil, then reduce to simmer (205°F/96°C)
- Cook 15-18 minutes until fork-tender
- Potatoes should just begin to crack at edges

### 4. Drain and Dry
- Drain thoroughly in colander
- Return to hot empty pot over low heat
- Shake for 30-60 seconds to steam off moisture
- This step is crucial for butter absorption!

### 5. Rice or Mash
- Rice potatoes directly back into warm pot
- Never use food processor or blender (causes gluey texture)

### 6. Add Butter First
- Add room-temp butter in cubes
- Fold gently until fully melted and coating potatoes
- Fat-first method creates silkier texture

### 7. Add Warm Milk
- Heat milk to 140-150°F (60-65°C)
- Add gradually, folding gently
- Stop when reaching desired consistency

### 8. Season and Serve
- Add salt ¼ tsp at a time, tasting
- Add pepper to preference
- Fold in optional add-ins just before serving

## Make-Ahead Tips

| Timing | Method | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Up to 2 hours | Hold in bowl over warm water | Cover tightly |
| Next day | Cool, cover surface with plastic | Reheat gently with extra milk |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Gluey texture | Over-mixing | Mix less, use ricer |
| Watery | Potatoes not dried | Steam off moisture |
| Lumpy | Under-cooked | Cook until very tender |
| Bland | Under-seasoned | Salt the cooking water well |

## Variations

### Garlic Mashed Potatoes
- Roast whole garlic head at 375°F for 45 minutes
- Squeeze cloves into butter before adding

### Herb-Infused
- Simmer milk with thyme or bay leaf
- Strain before adding

### Lighter Version
- Replace half butter with olive oil
- Use 2% milk
- Still delicious, slightly less rich

## Chef's Notes
- Yukon Golds have medium starch content = naturally creamy
- The potato ricer really does make a difference
- Leftover mash makes incredible fritters (see separate recipe)
- Always taste and adjust seasoning at the end
