*A refreshing Nanjing-style side*

## Overview
| Yield | Prep Time | Rest Time | Total | Difficulty |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 servings | 10 min | 20 min | 30 min | Easiest |

## Background
This light, refreshing salad is a staple in Nanjing cuisine. Unlike Sichuan versions with chili oil, this focuses on clean, crisp flavors that cleanse the palate.

## Ingredients

### Base
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| English cucumbers | 2 medium | Or 4 Persian |
| Salt | 2 tsp | For drawing moisture |

### Dressing
| Item | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Rice vinegar | 3 Tbsp | Mild acidity |
| Sugar | 2 tsp | Balances tang |
| Soy sauce | 1 tsp | Umami depth |
| Sesame oil | 1 tsp | Aromatic finish |
| Garlic | 2 cloves | Minced fine |

### Optional Garnish
- Toasted sesame seeds
- Thinly sliced scallions
- Fresh cilantro

## Method

### 1. Prepare Cucumbers
- Wash and dry cucumbers
- Smash with flat side of cleaver
- Tear/cut into bite-sized pieces
- **Why smash?** Creates irregular edges that absorb dressing

### 2. Salt and Drain
- Toss cucumber with salt
- Place in colander
- Let drain 20 minutes
- Rinse and pat dry
- **This step is crucial** - removes excess water

### 3. Make Dressing
- Whisk vinegar and sugar until dissolved
- Add soy sauce and garlic
- Let stand 5 minutes
- Stir in sesame oil last

### 4. Combine and Serve
- Toss cucumbers with dressing
- Let marinate 5-10 minutes
- Garnish if desired
- Serve cold

## The Science
- Salting draws out water = concentrated flavor
- Smashing = more surface area = better absorption
- Resting = flavors meld

## Variations

### Traditional Add-ins
- Wood ear mushrooms (soaked)
- Glass noodles
- Carrot julienne

### Modern Twists
- Add rice wine vinegar
- Thin ginger strips
- Miso in dressing

### Make it Heartier
- Add cooked shrimp
- Shredded chicken
- Hard-boiled eggs

## Storage Notes
- Best eaten within 2 hours
- Becomes watery if stored
- Dress just before serving for potlucks

## Pro Tips
1. Really dry cucumbers after salting
2. Taste dressing - adjust sweet/sour
3. Don't over-marinate
4. Chill plates for serving
5. Use good sesame oil

## Pairing Suggestions
- Perfect with Nanjing-style chicken
- Alongside any rich dish
- With grilled meats
- Part of cold appetizer spread
