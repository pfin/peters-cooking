## The Secret to Real Crunch
Getting a shatter-crisp crust requires the triple-coating method, even with egg already mixed into your mash.

## Base Recipe

### Ingredients for Filling
| Item | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Cold mashed potatoes | 2 cups (~400g) | Leftover Yukon Gold ideal |
| Large egg | 1 | Mixed into potatoes |
| Shredded sharp cheddar | ⅓ cup (35g) | Or Gruyère |
| Scallions or chives | 2 Tbsp | Finely chopped |
| Black pepper | ¼ tsp | Adjust to taste |
| Breadcrumbs (internal) | ¼ cup (15g) | For structure |

### For the Crispy Coating
| Station | Ingredients | Purpose |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Bowl 1 | ¼ cup flour + ¼ tsp salt + paprika | Dry surface for adhesion |
| Bowl 2 | 1 egg + 1 tsp water, beaten | The glue layer |
| Bowl 3 | ¾ cup panko + 2 Tbsp Parmesan | The crunch |

### Alternative Coating (no extra egg)
- 2 Tbsp flour + 3 Tbsp water (thin slurry)
- OR 2 Tbsp mayo + 1 Tbsp water
- OR 2 Tbsp yogurt + 1 Tbsp water

## Method

### 1. Mix and Firm the Filling
- If potatoes already have egg mixed in, just ensure mixture is cold
- Add extra breadcrumbs if too loose
- Refrigerate 15-20 minutes

### 2. Shape
- Scoop ¼ cup portions
- Roll into balls, flatten to ½ inch thick
- Place on parchment-lined tray
- Chill while setting up coating station

### 3. Triple-Coat for Crunch
1. Dredge in seasoned flour, tap excess
2. Dip in egg wash (or alternative)
3. Press firmly into panko mixture
4. **Critical**: Freeze 5-10 minutes to lock coating

### 4. Air Fry to Perfection

| Step | Temperature | Time | Action |
|------|-------------|------|--------|
| Preheat | 400°F (200°C) | 4 min | Empty basket |
| First side | 400°F | 4 min | Mist with oil spray |
| Flip & finish | 375°F | 4-5 min | Mist again |

**Oil mist is crucial** - spray from 6 inches until crumbs glisten

## Pro Tips for Maximum Crunch

### Coating Variations
| Addition | Amount | Effect |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Crushed kettle chips | Replace half panko | Extra crunch |
| Cornstarch | 1 Tbsp in flour | Glassy crisp |
| Parmesan | 2 Tbsp in panko | Savory boost |

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Pale crust | Not enough oil | Heavier spray |
| Crust falls off | Skipped freeze step | Always freeze 5-10 min |
| Soggy center | Too thick | Max ½ inch thick |
| Burned spots | Overcrowded | Leave space between |

## Make-Ahead Options

### Freeze Before Cooking
1. Complete through coating step
2. Flash freeze on tray
3. Store in freezer bags
4. Air fry from frozen, add 2-3 minutes

### Keep Warm
- 200°F oven on wire rack
- Door slightly open
- Maximum 20 minutes

## Serving Suggestions

### Classic Pairings
- Sour cream with chives
- Spicy aioli
- Apple sauce (surprisingly good!)

### Meal Ideas
- Breakfast with fried eggs
- Side for roast chicken
- Appetizer with dipping sauces

## Notes from Experience
- The chill steps aren't optional - they prevent blowouts
- Panko really does work better than regular breadcrumbs
- Oil spray beats brushing for even coverage
- These reheat well in air fryer (350°F, 3 min)
