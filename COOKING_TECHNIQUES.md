## Heat and Temperature Control

### Understanding Heat Levels

#### Low Heat (200-300°F / 93-149°C)
- **Uses**: Gentle simmering, melting chocolate, keeping food warm
- **Visual Cues**: Barely bubbling liquids, no sizzle
- **Common Mistakes**: Impatience leading to increased heat

#### Medium Heat (300-375°F / 149-190°C)
- **Uses**: Sautéing, pan-frying, sweating vegetables
- **Visual Cues**: Gentle sizzle, steady bubbles in liquids
- **Test**: Water droplets dance and evaporate slowly

#### Medium-High Heat (375-450°F / 190-232°C)
- **Uses**: Searing, stir-frying, browning
- **Visual Cues**: Oil shimmers, immediate sizzle
- **Test**: Water droplets ball up and roll

#### High Heat (450°F+ / 232°C+)
- **Uses**: Wok cooking, blackening, quick searing
- **Visual Cues**: Oil begins to smoke slightly
- **Warning**: Have all ingredients ready - things move fast

### The Maillard Reaction
- **What**: Browning of proteins and sugars
- **Temperature**: Begins around 280°F (138°C)
- **Key**: Dry surface essential - moisture prevents browning
- **Result**: Complex flavors, appealing color

## Basic Techniques

### The Perfect Sear

**Goal**: Develop a golden-brown crust while maintaining juicy interior

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Preparation**: Remove protein from fridge 20-30 minutes before cooking
2. **Dry Thoroughly**: Use paper towels, pat multiple times
3. **Season**: Salt draws out moisture, so either:
   - Salt 45+ minutes ahead (moisture reabsorbs)
   - Salt immediately before cooking
4. **Heat Pan**: Empty pan first, add oil when hot
5. **Oil Choice**: High smoke point - grapeseed, avocado, refined coconut
6. **The Sear**: 
   - Lay away from yourself to prevent splatter
   - Don't move for 3-4 minutes
   - Should release easily when ready
7. **Flip Once**: Develop crust on second side
8. **Finish**: In oven if thick, or reduce heat if thin

**Common Applications**:
- [Perfect Pan-Seared Steak](recipes/mains/perfect-pan-seared-steak.md)
- [Pan-Seared Sea Bass](recipes/mains/pan-seared-sea-bass.md)

**Troubleshooting**:
- Sticking: Not hot enough or moved too soon
- No browning: Surface wet or heat too low
- Burnt outside, raw inside: Heat too high

### Blanching and Shocking

**Goal**: Partially cook while preserving color, texture, and nutrients

**The Science**: 
- Blanching denatures enzymes that cause browning
- Shocking halts cooking immediately
- Chlorophyll stays bright green

**Detailed Method**:
1. **Setup**: Large pot of salted boiling water + bowl of ice water
2. **Salt Level**: Like sea water - 1 tbsp per quart
3. **Timing by Vegetable**:
   - Green beans: 2-3 minutes
   - Broccoli florets: 2 minutes
   - Asparagus: 1-2 minutes
   - Leafy greens: 30 seconds
4. **The Transfer**: Use spider or slotted spoon
5. **Ice Bath**: Equal ice and water, fully submerge
6. **Final Step**: Drain thoroughly, pat dry

**Advanced Applications**:
- Pre-cook vegetables for stir-fries
- Prep vegetables for freezing
- Brighten herbs for sauces

### Proper Egg Scrambling

**Goal**: Creamy, silky curds with no browning

**The French Method** (Classic):
1. **Whisk Thoroughly**: No white streaks remain
2. **Add Fat**: 1 tbsp butter per 3 eggs
3. **Low Heat Always**: Takes patience
4. **Constant Motion**: Figure-8 pattern with spatula
5. **On and Off Heat**: 30 seconds on, 20 seconds off
6. **Stop Early**: Remove while still slightly wet
7. **Finish**: Stir in crème fraîche or butter

**The American Method** (Fluffy):
1. **Higher Heat**: Medium-low instead of low
2. **Let Set**: Allow bottom to cook 20 seconds
3. **Fold Don't Stir**: Large, gentle movements
4. **Bigger Curds**: Less agitation than French
5. **Still Creamy**: Remove before fully set

**Recipe**: [Fluffy Scrambled Eggs](recipes/breakfast/fluffy-scrambled-eggs.md)

**Pro Tips**:
- Room temperature eggs cook more evenly
- Salt at the end (prevents watery eggs)
- Add liquid for lighter texture (milk, cream, water)

### Proper Sautéing

**Goal**: Cook quickly while developing flavor

**Essential Elements**:
1. **Pan Size**: Food in single layer, not crowded
2. **Heat First**: Pan hot before oil
3. **Oil Coverage**: Thin layer, not pooling
4. **Dry Ingredients**: Moisture causes steaming not sautéing
5. **Movement**: Toss or stir, don't let sit
6. **Salt Timing**: End of cooking to prevent moisture

**The Process**:
1. Heat empty pan over medium-high
2. Add oil, swirl to coat
3. Oil should shimmer but not smoke
4. Add ingredients starting with aromatics
5. Keep things moving - sauté means "jump"
6. Adjust heat if browning too fast

**Common Mistakes**:
- Overcrowding (causes steaming)
- Cold pan (no caramelization)
- Too much oil (becomes shallow frying)
- Not enough movement (uneven cooking)

## Intermediate Techniques

### Braising

**Goal**: Transform tough cuts into tender, flavorful dishes

**The Science**: 
- Low, moist heat breaks down collagen into gelatin
- Partially submerged food cooks by steam and liquid
- Long cooking time develops deep flavors

**Classic Method**:
1. **Sear First**: Brown meat on all sides
2. **Remove Protein**: Set aside
3. **Aromatics**: Sauté onions, carrots, celery
4. **Deglaze**: Wine, stock, or other liquid
5. **Return Protein**: Should be 1/2 to 2/3 submerged
6. **Low and Slow**: 
   - Oven: 325°F (163°C)
   - Stovetop: Gentle simmer
7. **Time**: 2-4 hours depending on cut
8. **Test**: Fork tender, not falling apart

**Nanjing-Style Braising** (Special Technique):
- Even gentler - barely perceptible movement
- Sweet-savory balance without overwhelming

- [Nanjing-Style Lion's Head](recipes/mains/nanjing-style-lions-head.md)

### Emulsification

**Goal**: Combine oil and water into stable mixture

**Types**:
1. **Temporary**: Vinaigrettes (will separate)
2. **Permanent**: Mayonnaise, hollandaise (won't separate)

**Making Mayonnaise** (Master Recipe):
1. **Room Temperature**: All ingredients
2. **Start Slow**: Drop by drop of oil initially
3. **Whisk Constantly**: Or use immersion blender
4. **Listen**: Sound changes when emulsion forms
5. **Steady Stream**: Once emulsified, add oil faster
6. **Rescue**: If breaks, start with new yolk

**Vinaigrette Secrets**:
- Mustard acts as emulsifier
- 3:1 ratio oil to acid (adjust to taste)
- Shake in jar for easy emulsion
- Make fresh - best within hours

### Reduction Sauces

**Goal**: Concentrate flavors through evaporation

**Basic Technique**:
1. **Deglaze**: After searing, add liquid to hot pan
2. **Scrape**: Loosen all browned bits (fond)
3. **Simmer**: Not boil - too vigorous loses nuance
4. **Watch Carefully**: Can go from perfect to ruined quickly
5. **Test**: Coat back of spoon (nappe consistency)
6. **Finish**: Swirl in cold butter for gloss

**Reduction Ratios**:
- By half: Good for wine reductions
- By 2/3: Pan sauces
- By 3/4 or more: Glazes

**Flavor Builders**:
- Wine: Adds acidity and complexity
- Stock: Adds body and umami
- Cream: Adds richness, reduces less

### Stir-Frying

**Goal**: Quick cooking maintaining distinct textures

**Mise en Place Critical**:
- Everything cut uniformly
- Sauces mixed and ready
- Aromatics minced
- No time once started

**The Process**:
1. **Heat Wok**: Until smoking
2. **Oil Application**: Swirl to coat sides
3. **Aromatics First**: 10 seconds max
4. **Proteins Next**: Cook 80%, remove
5. **Vegetables**: Hardest first
6. **Combine**: Return everything
7. **Sauce**: Pour around edges
8. **Toss**: Everything coated

**Home Kitchen Adaptations**:
- Work in batches
- Highest heat possible
- Don't overcrowd
- Have exhaust fan on
